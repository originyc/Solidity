This repo includes various files needed to compile and run my code.

Go to Contracts/src/projects for my newest projects. 
As of now, I have finished a smart contract with a lottery that costs 0.1 ETH to enter, and requires at least 3 entrants.

Contracts/src includes various functions and features I have been experimenting with.
